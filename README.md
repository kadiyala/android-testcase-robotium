android-testcase
================

Creating a very, very simple yet useful project for Android Testcase. I am using the robotium library for testing . 

$ adb shell am instrument com.example.activitytransitiontest/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner

for command-line usage . Make sure you run the apk to the device/emulator at least once before testing.
